\section{Introduction.}
Nearest neighbor searching is the following problem: 
We are given a set \textit{S} of \textit{n} data points in a metric space, \texit{X},
and the task is to preprocess these points so that,
given any query point $q \in X$,
the data point nearest to \textit{q} can be reported quickly.
This is also called the closest-point problem and the post office problem.
Nearest neighbor searching is an important problem in a variety of applications, including 
statistics [Devroye and Wagner 1982],
pattern recognition and classification [Cover and Hart 1967; Duda and Hart 1973],
document retrieval [Deerwester et al. 1990],
data compression [Gersho and Gray 1991],
machine learning [Cost and Salzberg 1993],
multimedia databases [Flickner et al. 1995],
and knowledge discovery and data mining [Fayyad et al. 1996].

Hierarchical data structures are useful because of their ability to focus on the
interesting subsets of the data. 
This focusing results in an efficient representation and improved execution times and is thus
particularly useful for performing set operations

\section{Nearest Neighbor Searching using B-trees}
B-tree is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted
and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, 
and deletions in logarithmic time. 
The B-tree is a generalization of a binary search tree 
in that a node can have more than two children (Comer 1979, p. 123).
To store the points in the B-tree, an order relation was used.

\subsection{Algorithm for B-trees}
Given an order relation, it's easy to search the predecessor / successor,
but we can't guarantee that any of them is the nearest.
Then we need to keep looking, to ensure we have the nearest point.
Since we're using a relation of lexicographical order,
we can stop lookin for points, 
when the difference betwen the first coordinate,
is greater than the minimum distance found.

\begin{algorithm}[t]
  \KwData{T: B-tree with the points, p: point to find its nearest neighbor}
  \KwResult{the nearest neighbor of p}
  x = find-node(p)\;
  \lIf{x != NULL}{return p\;}
  ans = NULL\;
  r = s = p\;
  \While{r != NULL or s != NULL}{
    \uIf{r != NULL}{
      r = predecessor(T,r)\;
      \lIf{ans = NULL or dist(ans,p) $>$ dist(p,r)}{ans = r\;}
      x = find-node(r)\;
      \uIf{x.leaf}{
        \ForEach{r child of x}{\lIf{dist(ans,p) $>$ dist(r,p)}{ans = r\;}}
        r = x.first-child\;
      }
      \lIf{dist(ans,p) $<$ p.x - r.x}{r = NULL\;}
    }
    \uIf{s != NULL}{
      s = successor(T,s)\;
      \lIf{ans = NULL or dist(ans,p) $>$ dist(p,s)}{ans = s\;}
      x = find-node(r)\;
      \uIf{x.leaf}{
        \ForEach{s child of x}{\lIf{dist(ans,p) $>$ dist(p,s)}{ans = s\;}}
        s = x.last-child\;
      }
      \lIf{dist(ans,p) $<$ s.x - p.x}{s = NULL\;}
    }    
  }

\section{Quadtree}
The term quadtree is used to describe a class of hierarchical data structures whose
common property is that they are based on the principle of recursive decomposition of space.
They can be differentiated on the following bases: 
(1) the type of data that they are used to represent, 
(2) the principle guiding the decomposition process, and 
(3) the resolution (variable or not)


A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. 
Quadtrees are most often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively 
subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. 
The regions may be square or rectangular, or may have arbitrary shapes. 
This data structure was named a quadtree by Raphael Finkel and J.L. Bentley in 1974. 

In this section, we introduce the \textit{balanced box-decomposition tree} or BBD-tree,
which is a data structure used in our algorithm. 
It is among the general class of geometric data structures based on a hierarchical decomposition of space
into \textit{d}-dimensional rectangles whose sides are orthogonal to the coordinate axes.
The main feature of the BBD-tree is that it combines in one data structure two
important features that are present in these data structures.
This data structure recursively subdivides space by a hyperplane that is orthogonal to one
of the coordinate axes and that partitions the data points as evenly as possible.
As a consequence, as one descends any path in the tree, the cardinality of points
associated with the nodes on this path decreases exponentially.
